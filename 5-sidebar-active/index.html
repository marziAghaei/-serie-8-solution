        <h2>The Biggest Environmental Problems</h2>
        
        <p>Economists and environmentalists have urged policymakers for years to
           increase the price of activities that emit greenhouse gases (one of our 
           biggest environmental problems), the lack of which constitutes the largest
            market failure, for example through carbon taxes, which will stimulate innovations
             in low-carbon technologies.To cut emissions quickly and effectively enough,
              governments must not only massively increase funding for green innovation to bring
               down the costs of low-carbon energy sources, but they also need to adopt a range of
                other policies that address each of the other market failures.  </p>
